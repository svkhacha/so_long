# About so_long
This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to improve the working skills with textures, sprites, and some other basic gameplay elements.

We are going to use the school graphical library: the **_MiniLibX!_** This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events. (find more information in <a href="https://github.com/svkhacha/so_long/files/9738006/en.subject.pdf" target="_blank">**subject**</a>)
